# @cdc/map

`<CdcMap />` is a React component for visualizing your data on a map of the United States. This was built for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's internal use and has been open sourced. There is support for filtering, toggling, numeric and categorical mapping as well as many other visual configuration options like color schemes. It can be used standalone or in conjunction with the larger CDC Open Visualization framework.

* Supports both U.S. and World maps.
* Focus on accessibility and 508 compliance.
* IE11 support.

* [World Map](https://www.cdc.gov/wcms/4.0/cdc-wp/data-presentation/examples/example-world-data-map.html)
* [Categorical Map](https://www.cdc.gov/wcms/4.0/cdc-wp/data-presentation/examples/example-categorical-maps.html)
* [Filterable Map](https://www.cdc.gov/wcms/4.0/cdc-wp/data-presentation/examples/example-numeric-maps-filterable.html)

### Installation and Usage

1. Install the package in your React project `npm install @cdc/map`
2. Import the component and begin using in your code.
```JSX
import CdcMap from '@cdc/map'

function App() {

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <CdcMap />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Note: If no properties are passed, the map will load a default configuration file.

### Properties

| Property          | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| navigationHandler | Function | A custom function that will receive the URL of the item that was clicked by the user. This will override the built in navigationHandler. It's helpful if you need to implement a custom metrics call or some other kind of intermediate behavior before you direct the user to the URL. |
| configUrl         | String   | Pass a URL to a .json file and it will be consumed and used as the configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| config            | Object   | You can pass the raw configuration object directly as a prop. For help generating such an object, use the built in editor.                                                                                                                                                              |
| isEditor          | Boolean  | A simple flag that will load the editor for the maps inside your app. Helpful to provide a user interface instead of having to edit raw JSON.                                                                                                                                           |
| className         | String   | Lets you add a custom class name to the outermost container element of the map.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Data Formatting

**TODO: Move this to data designer/editor package once that is finished.**

The data that you are mapping needs to be formatted in a specific way where there is one column for each row that represents the state or city for the rest of the data on that row. There needs to be an additional column that represents the data you are trying to display on the map. This can be categorical or numerical data. You will specifically map these columns in the editor.

The supported formats are CSV and JSON files.

For more information, read the [CDC's official guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/wcms/4.0/cdc-wp/data-presentation/instructions/data-map-instructions.html) on formatting and to get example data files.

## Contributing

To get started working on this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo and do an `npm install & npm link @cdc/map`. This installs your dependencies and links the namespace `@cdc/map` to your local folder (see step 4 for more.)
2. Simply run `npm start` and it will open the project in development mode.
3. To create an actual built version of the library for testing, run `npm run build`
4. To test the package out locally inside a different project, after building you need to go into that folder and run `npm link @cdc/map`. It should begin using your local version so you can make changes and view them.
